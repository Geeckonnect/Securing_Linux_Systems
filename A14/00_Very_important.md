# Hardening Linux systems

## Please note the following points

The hardening of Linux systems must be considered individually. There is no generally applicable solution.

1. first find out exactly what information you need about the system to be hardened (services, ports, processes, etc.).
2. talk to the person responsible for the system.
3. create a plan/concept of how you want to proceed. Make a note of the steps so that you can return to a functioning state in an emergency.
4. check after each step whether the system is working 100%.
